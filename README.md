# Superforecasting Project - Business Analytics

## Overview
This project applies **Bayesian forecasting** to predict outcomes for three real-world scenarios:

1. **England National Team's performance in Euro 2024**
2. **Likelihood of a U.S.-Russia military confrontation in 2024**
3. **Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 42,000 in 2024**

## Methodology
This study employs **Bayesian inference**, a probabilistic approach that updates prior beliefs with new data. **Cluster analysis** is used to evaluate influential factors for each scenario.

### 1. England's Euro 2024 Performance
- **Bayesian Prior:** England's historical performance in past Euro tournaments.
- **Key Factors:**
  - **Rankings:** Consistently ranked in the top 3 since 2002, #1 for the last three years.
  - **Manager’s Experience:** Gareth Southgate led England to the Euro 2020 final and World Cup 2018 semifinals.
  - **Squad Strength:** Presence of elite players like Harry Kane, Phil Foden, and Jude Bellingham.
- **Prediction:** **74% probability of reaching the semifinals**, though injuries and tactics may influence results.

### 2. U.S.-Russia Lethal Confrontation
- **Bayesian Prior:** No direct military confrontations between nuclear superpowers in 70 years.
- **Key Factors:**
  - **U.S. Elections:** A 40.8% probability of the Democratic Party retaining power, shaping foreign policy.
  - **Russia-Ukraine War:** Increased aggression or Ukraine’s potential defeat could escalate tensions.
  - **Historical Precedents:** Cuban Missile Crisis and Cold War tensions suggest diplomatic resolution is preferred.
- **Prediction:** **8.1% probability of a lethal confrontation**, making war highly unlikely.

### 3. Dow Jones Forecast
- **Bayesian Prior:** DJIA historical growth trends and milestone surpassing patterns.
- **Key Factors:**
  - **Geopolitical Events:** Trade policies, global conflicts, and economic sanctions impact investor sentiment.
  - **Technological Developments:** The IT sector’s expansion drives market growth.
  - **Elections & Policies:** Government regulations influence corporate performance.
  - **Market Sentiment:** Investor confidence and trading behaviors shape market trends.
- **Prediction:** **Moderate probability** of the **DJIA surpassing 42,000** by year-end.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Forecasting & Predictive Analytics:** Bayesian modeling, probability estimation.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Applying statistics to real-world forecasting.
- **Business & Market Analysis:** Evaluating macroeconomic trends and financial markets.

## Conclusion
This project showcases **business analytics and predictive modeling** in real-world forecasting. By leveraging **Bayesian inference** and **structured data analysis**, it provides actionable insights into macroeconomic trends and geopolitical risks.
